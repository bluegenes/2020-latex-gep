Current plan 2/26:

ntp:  
+ Introduction: add context for publicly-available sequencing data. Add references for experimental design & stats. Reorganize & reframe. Concept: “you don’t know what you don’t know”. Contextualize w/ lit papers.
+ Add to comp section:https://datacarpentry.org/cloud-genomics/04-which-cloud/index.html
+ If sequencing: make sure your seq tech will actually work for your q


ter:
+ Quality control: add more general quality control info (non-box text)
    + To fastqc section: situations where fastqc is _not_ useful / a note to pay attn only to the right bits
    + Batch effects 
    + Lib prep methods lead to different batch effects
    + Box: developing an intuition for what quality data look like
        What’s reasonable to expect? What does a good alignment to a genome look like? what does a good fastqc look like? how to develop an intuition about good data?
        3-4 exmples of good data.
        radseq fastqc
        differential expression on naturally occurring vs clonal, expectations for log2fc.
        tell people how to find out this type of information with examples
+ find/add references to qc protocols & tools
03/17/20
+ Workflows section 
    + GUI-based: galaxy, 7 bridges genomics, qiime2?, cyverse/iplant
    + code-based workflows: snakemake, nextflow, CWL
    + make a note of paid solutions
+ Add some text to software (what's all the fuss, what does software even look like?)
+ version control for data (OSF). 

To do:
+ Info on non-conda installations (containers, r-specific method, etc)
+ FAIR data principles
+ Curated references for all tools/protocols
+ ref table for diff types of sequence analysis? (popgen vs metag vs radseq etc)? - would need to be v. broad, just a “where to start” for each.
+ version control for data -- osf. links to google drive
